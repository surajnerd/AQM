                       Composed of pro players with winning repertoires, AC Milan QLASH came out of the gates strong, sprinting to the EMEA March Grand Final with consecutive sweeping sets until they were pitted against SK Gaming. iKaoss is their notorious “Spin to Win'' player with an antagonistic demeanor, and Mr LeNain is known for his use of his go-to Brawler, Mortis. GuilleVGX has been playing Brawl Stars competitively since 2019 with notable achievements such as the Red Bull MEO in 2020. In June, Yoshi, who was previously on Free Agents, joined the team to complete the all-star roster of AC Milan QLASH. The team has now qualified for World Finals and we’re excited to see them on the global stage!</h1>
